1. Add the 'sparkly-auth' gem as a Rails dependency. Do NOT remove the Authlogic dependency, because you'll need it
   in order to maintain your existing passwords.
   
2. Generate the Sparkly files. At a minimum, you need to generate sparkly config and sparkly migrations. Controllers
   are optional (but I generated them).

3. Edit config/initializers/sparkly_authentication.rb and set config.encryptor to whatever Authlogic encryptor you are
   using. Or, if you're using some other encryptor, anything compatible with Authlogic (that is, anything implementing
   both #encrypt(*tokens) and #matches?(crypted, *tokens)), you can use that. By default, Sha512 is used by both
   Authlogic and Sparkly Authentication -- so if you've never changed it, you can skip this step.
    Ex:
      config.encryptor = Authlogic::CryptoProviders::Sha512
      
4. Run the rake task auth:migrate:authlogic, which will migrate the Authlogic database information into the data that
   Sparkly Auth can make use of.

5. Unless you're using one of the Authlogic crypto providers, you can go ahead and remove the Authlogic gem
   dependencies.
