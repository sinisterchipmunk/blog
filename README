== A Blog

Essentially, I've decided to try my hand at writing a blogging engine from the ground-up as a new project. You're free
to clone this project and use it yourself, if you wish. It's currently a full-fledged Rails application, but I'm hoping
to turn it into a more modular Rails plugin or gem so that a blog can be easily added to any standard Rails app at some
point in the future.
