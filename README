== A Blog

Essentially, I've decided to try my hand at writing a blogging engine from the ground-up as a new project. You're free
to clone this project and use it yourself, if you wish. It's currently a full-fledged Rails application, but I'm hoping
to turn it into a more modular Rails plugin or gem so that a blog can be easily added to any standard Rails app at some
point in the future.

== Setting Up

Bear in mind that this isn't exactly designed for 3rd party use, yet. That said, it's not too difficult to get off the
ground:

    git clone git://github.com/sinisterchipmunk/blog.git myblog
    cd myblog
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    >> start tweaking <<
