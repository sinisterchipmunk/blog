== A Blog

Note: You should DEFINITELY NOT check out this repository. Feel free to do it anyway, but you've been warned.

Essentially, I've decided to try my hand at writing a blogging engine from the ground-up as a new project. Mostly just
for something to do, but if it turns out nicely, I'll make it a public repo with a proper name. If you want to clone
this one at any time, go ahead, but I don't guarantee it'll work at any given time. If you want a working blog engine,
wait for me to rename this repository to something more suitable. Until then, the "blog" project is most likely
something you don't want to mess with.

For what it's worth, it's released (or will be) under the MIT license.
